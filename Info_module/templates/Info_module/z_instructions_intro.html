            In this business simulation, you will be the manager of a small bakery.
            Every evening, as a manager, you order loaves of bread from your supplier to sell them on the next day.
            The demand for bread is <u><strong>uncertain</strong></u> and it fluctuates <u><strong>independently</strong></u> from day to day.
            Historically, the demand was as high as 600 loaves of bread a day.
            Any unsold bread will be thrown away at the end of each day.

            Your objective is to <strong> maximize your cumulative profit</strong>
            for the <strong>next {{ total_rounds }} days.</strong>

             <p style="padding-top: 0px; text-align:left">
                <strong> You can calculate your profit using the formula below:</strong> </p>

                <div style="font-size:12pt; text-align:center">(Unit selling price (={{Constants.sale_price| c}}) x Amount sold) - (Unit purchase cost (={{Constants.cost | c}}) x Amount ordered)</div>
            </p>


        <p style="padding-top: 10px">
            The amount sold is determined by the number of loaves you ordered and the demand for that day.<br>
            If the demand is less than the amount ordered, you will throw away the unsold bread you already paid for.<br>
            Every loaf of bread you throw away costs you <strong> {{Constants.cost | c}} </strong> (Unit purchase cost). <br>
            <br>
            If the demand is more than the amount ordered, you will miss the opportunity to sell more and make more profit.<br>
            For every additional loaf you could have ordered, you would have made additional
            <strong> {{Constants.sale_price |c }} - {{Constants.cost |c }} = 2 E$ </strong> (=Unit selling price - Unit purchase cost)
