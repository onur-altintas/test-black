    <s>According to the vendor, the A.I. algorithm can map important and non-linear features and reduce them into
        variables that can help to understand the past and to improve managerial decision-making.
        However, it is up to you whether to follow BakerAI's recommendation or not.
        You can keep using your best judgement to determine the order quantity for the next day or you can follow BakerAI's recommendation.</s>

            <p><div style="text-align: center;"><u><strong>Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) support:</strong></u></div>
            A software company, called SmartBaker Co., is offering you a free trial of its new artificial intelligence software.
            Every evening, the A.I. will recommend you how many breads you should order for the next day.
            It is up to you whether to follow the A.I.'s recommendation or not.
            You can either use your best judgement to determine the order quantity for the next day or you can follow the A.I.'s recommendation.

        Their claim is that the AI can give you good suggestions on number of
        breads to order every evening. You are considering to use this artificial intelligence software to help you with your order decision.
