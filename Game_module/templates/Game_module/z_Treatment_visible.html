            You will receive recommendations from the Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) on how many loaves of bread to order for the next day.
            It is important to understand how BakerAI works when you decide whether to follow its recommendation or not.
            Therefore, we would like to spend a couple minutes to explain the dynamics of the A.I. recommendation below.

                    BakerAI's algorithm does not have any information about your demand, thus it cannot precisely predict
                    the demand for the next day. However, it chooses the best order quantity by factoring two important elements:</span>
                    <ol><span style="font-weight: 600" >
                        <li>Exploring your demand distribution by either increasing or decreasing the last order quantity</li>
                        <li>Maximizing your profit by balancing the expected cost of ordering either too many,
                    or too few loaves of bread</li></span>
                    </ol>
                <span>
                    BakerAI will get better at maximizing your cumulative profit,
                    if you follow its recommendation every day.

                    On Day 8, you didn't have that much demand for the bread and you could only sell 40 loaves.
